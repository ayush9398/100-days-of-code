### Day 0: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: univariate linear regression, gradient descent 

**Thoughts:** Continued the ML course by Mr. Andrew Ng on coursera, 1st week videos are almost over. Feeling excited!

### Day 1: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: multivariate linear regression, feature scaling and mean normalization 

**Thoughts:** Introduced to Matlab programming and learned about multivariate linear regression, need to work on contour plots more.

### Day 2: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: polynomial regression and normal equation 

**Thoughts:** Polynomial regression an normal equation are some new concepts to me. Just theory related part till now, next part involves octave programming.
